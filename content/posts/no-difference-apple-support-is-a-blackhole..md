Oh my ... guys. I am losing my battle with Apple. It makes no sense to me, but it's happening. The past couple of days have been pure-shit. Grrr!

If you think your super expensive laptop made in the USA is better than a super cheap model made in China/Korea/Spain, then think again! Apple, as a company, works hard to maintain its image as being perfect (including the support they provide). But as I recently learned, they are no different than any other company. It's just an image for your brain; it's marketing.

In the 20 years that I have been using laptops, I have NEVER EEEEEEEVER had as many problems as I am having with my Apple laptop. I repeat: NEVER has a battery exploded! Yes, you heard me! Exploded like a bomb! I have had a number of laptops â€“ including laptops from HP, IBM, Lenovo, and Acer - and have never had this happen to me. The batteries in those laptops generally last for five to six years. While that isn't great, it's standard for the market.

This time, after just four years, the battery in my MacBook exploded. Oh man! This is terrible. In this thread [Mavericks - power use / service battery](https://discussions.apple.com/message/23505531), there are currently 65,658 views and 342 replies. Nothing more to say.

:(

Update 1: 10.9.3 does not solve the issue (at the moment).
Update 2: I lost my battle. I have bought this battery: [http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B008XXK5XS/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B008XXK5XS/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
Update 3: At the moment, two weeks with this new battery and I think the temperature is higher than the original battery when it's charging. However, it's okay. About 4.30 hours of battery autonomy.
