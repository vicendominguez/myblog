A tiny translation of my post:[http://www.securityartwork.es/2014/01/07/tor-zeigeist-2013/](http://www.securityartwork.es/2014/01/07/tor-zeigeist-2013/)

My steps for this report:

I created a .onion domain  
I kept it hidden to Tor (without wiki publishing...)  
After that, I created in that .onion domain one static web page: Gray background and only one "post" box like Google search webpage.  
I Put a little tittle: "search engine" or similar  
And I "Logged" the words in the search box.  

Now we had to wait... exactly 6 months.

This is the result:

Welcome to TOR top-search-words. Oh my...! :O
