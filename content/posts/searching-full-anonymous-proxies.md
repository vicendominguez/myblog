I have created a PoC to try to get full anonymous proxies. This script discovers if your IP is fully changed and anonymous using a proxy. It works via NSE by NMAP.

I wrote one post about it in Spanish here: [Security Artwork](http://www.securityartwork.es/2013/05/14/a-vueltas-con-la-deteccion-de-proxys/)

The PoC source code is available here: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vicendominguez/http-open-proxy-anon)
