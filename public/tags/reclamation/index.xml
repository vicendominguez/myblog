      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh my &amp;hellip; guys. I am losing my battle with Apple. It makes no sense to me, but it&amp;rsquo;s happening. The past couple of days have been pure-shit. Grrr!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you think your super expensive laptop made in the USA is better than a super cheap model made in China/Korea/Spain, then think again! Apple, as a company, works hard to maintain its image as being perfect (including the support they provide). But as I recently learned, they are no different than any other company. It&amp;rsquo;s just an image for your brain; it&amp;rsquo;s marketing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
