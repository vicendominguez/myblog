      <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem with NGINX is perfectly commented by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dmsimard&#34;&gt;David Moreau Simard&lt;/a&gt; in his blog post: &lt;em&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://dmsimard.com/2014/06/21/a-use-case-of-tengine-a-drop-in-replacement-and-fork-of-nginx/&#34;&gt;use case of Tengine, a drop-in replacement and fork of nginx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The summary is in this paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I noticed a problem when using nginx as a load balancer in front of servers that are the target of large and numerous uploads. nginx buffers the request of the body, which drives a lot of discussion in the nginx mailing lists. This effectively means that the file is uploaded twice. You upload a file to nginx, which acts as a reverse proxy/load balancer, and nginx waits until the file is finished uploading before sending it to one of the available backends. The buffer will happen either in memory or to an actual file, depending on configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
